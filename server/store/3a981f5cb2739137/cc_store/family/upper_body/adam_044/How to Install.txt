--HOW TO INSTALL--

1. Extract the 0xx folder from the ZIP folder to 
(location of your wrapper folder)/wrapper-offline/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137/cc_store/family/upper_body

2. Rename the 0xx folder to any number that has not been used yet.

3. Go to the family folder and open cc_theme.xml with Notepad or any program that can edit XML files.

4. Scroll down until you find one of the following:
        <component type="upper_body" id="adam_001" path="adam_001" name="adam_001" thumb="thumbnail.swf" display_order="10" money="0" sharing="0" enable="Y">
            <state id="chuckle" filename="chuckle.swf"/>
            <state id="crossed_arms" filename="crossed_arms.swf"/>
            <state id="dance" filename="dance.swf"/>
            <state id="default" filename="default.swf"/>
            <state id="excited" filename="excited.swf"/>
            <state id="fearful" filename="fearful.swf"/>
            <state id="kneel_down" filename="kneel_down.swf"/>
            <state id="laugh" filename="laugh.swf"/>
            <state id="lie_down" filename="lie_down.swf"/>
            <state id="point_at" filename="point_at.swf"/>
            <state id="run" filename="run.swf"/>
            <state id="sad" filename="sad.swf"/>
            <state id="sit" filename="sit.swf"/>
            <state id="talk" filename="talk.swf"/>
            <state id="talk_on_phone" filename="talk_on_phone.swf"/>
            <state id="taunt" filename="taunt.swf"/>
            <state id="walk" filename="walk.swf"/>
        </component>

5. Copy the whole component, create a new line, and replace the "xx" with the number you set the Adam Raglan Shirt folder to.

6. You're done! Go to the Comedy World Adam Character Creator on Wrapper Offline and Adam Raglan Shirt should be there!
