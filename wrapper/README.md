## DISCLAIMER
This API was meant to be used locally, and NOT to be hosted online.

# Wrapper
This is an API wrapper for the Legacy Video Maker, which had been retired on *19th December 2019, 03:10 UTC*.	Unlike other services that attempt to sole the same problem, this project allows the LVM to access data peristence and is very portable.
## How to Use
To access this service, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download this project.	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd {PATH}
npm install
npm start
```
**When done, it should open an electron app that has flash built in..**
