*** Portable Version ***

    Portable Balabolka does not require an installation and can be
    run from a USB drive. A computer must have at least one voice
    installed.



*** Text-To-Speech Engines ***

    Balabolka uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to read text files.
    If you have a TTS installed, you will see a list of available
    voices in the main window of Balabolka.

    The program supports both SAPI 4 and SAPI 5 Text-To-Speech
    Engines. SAPI 4 is an older technology, so I recommend the using
    of SAPI 5.

    If you are interested in some higher quality voices, please see
    the help file of Balabolka.



*** Microsoft Speech Platform ***

    The Microsoft Speech Platform consists of a Runtime and Runtime Languages
    (engines for speech recognition and text-to-speech). There are separate Runtime
    Languages for speech recognition and speech synthesis.

    Use the following steps to install the Microsoft Speech Platform:

    1 Uninstall any previous version of the Speech Platform Runtime from your computer.
    2 Determine whether you are using a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.
    3 Download and install the Speech Platform Runtime that matches your operating system.
    4 Download and install Runtime Languages for use with the Speech Platform.

    Balabolka is the 32-bit application. You need to install the 32-bit Runtime package
    for Microsoft Speech Platform, to use it in Balabolka.
