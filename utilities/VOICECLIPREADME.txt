How to use the voice clip importing workaround:
1. Import (or record and then import) your voice clip using custom_voiceclip.bat (Must be in *.mp3 format)
2. In the LVM, set the language to "Any Language" and make sure the voice is set to "Custom Voice Clip".
3. Type a single period in the textbox (.) and hit the Generate button.

Your voice clip will play and it will be added and cached in the video successfully.

Everytime you import a new voice clip however, do keep in mind that it will overwrite whatever previous voice clip you imported.
